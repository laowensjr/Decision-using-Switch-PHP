I created a function that can search the eatery based on Type, Owner Name, Last Name, Phone, Eatery Name, City, State, or Zip Code.
This function will take two parameters. One parameter is named dbColumnToSearch and the other is named searchValue.
I chose to use a switch clause that would perform different queries based upon its value received through the function. The major 
difference would depend upon the case condition's value within the switch clause. An example would be if it we were searching for the 
Owners Name the query within the case condition would use the search value to search the first and last name columns of the owner table
within the database. 

Essentially it's one big function with similarly case conditions. The only change in the query is within the where clause.
